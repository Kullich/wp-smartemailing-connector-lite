# Case Study — SmartEmailing Connector Lite

**Overview.** A vendor‑neutral WordPress plugin for capturing emails (shortcode, auto‑insert, popup) and sending them via AJAX to a configurable REST API (e.g., SmartEmailing).

**Highlights**
- Minimal footprint, no runtime deps.
- Nonce‑protected AJAX endpoint.
- Content injector: drop-in lead capture without editing templates.
- Popup with delay & frequency using localStorage.

**Why it’s in my portfolio**
I designed it to be easily brandable and integrable across projects without leaking internal names or client specifics.
